# NOT ANOTHER CHANNEL

![not another channel](https://notanotherchannel.github.io/pretty/notanotherchannel.jpg)

I created this project for two reasons. One, because I'm in 180+ channels at work and it's a joke. Two, because I wanted to make a pure JS site to bring me back to the old days. 

**Notable code things:**

 - Plain JS, plain CSS, plain HTML
 - [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) - backend (honestly incredibly easy and highly recommended)
 - [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/) - itty bitty css helper

# What's the purpose?
I made this as a light hearted work joke you can share with friends and colleagues. It really doesn't have a hard purpose. I am interested to see how many channels can get added though. 

## Contributing
If you want to make a PR, go ahead! But to be perfectly honest, I'm probably not going to maintain this. It's rather simple.
